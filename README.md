This repository contains files which have been created for a first conceptual design of a tilt-rotor UAV with an application in the field of medical goods delivery.

### Discription
The problem presented in this assignment was to use prior given requirements to develope an UAV and analyse its aerodynamic properties in a simplified manner. 

The scenario and the requirements have been made by utilising given information from the internet. The system has been desgined to fit the given operation requirements of the NHS in the UK.

This repository contains the CAD model, which has been created with CATIA V5, the used airfoil of the aircraft and the XFLR5 simulation files.

For a further understanding is the assignment attached as a pdf. Due to a page restriction in the main part, is the design report of the system attached as an appendix.
