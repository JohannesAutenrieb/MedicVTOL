This repository contains files which have been created for a first conceptual design of a tilt-rotor UAV with an application in the field of medical goods delivery.

### Discription
This Project was created as part of the Introduction to UAS Technology module which was held by Dr. Nicolas Avdelidis, Cranfield University for the students of the master course Autonomous Vehicle Dynamics and Control at Cranfield University. This repository contains the MATLAB/Simulink software in which the longitudinal flight dynamic model of a transsonic missile has been augmented with uncertanties and afterwards analysed.

The problem presented in this assignment was to use prior given requirements to develope an UAV and analyse its aerodynamic properties in a simplified manner. 

The scenario and the requirements have been made by utilising given information from the internet. The system has been desgined to fit the given operation requirements of the NHS in the UK.

This repository contains the CAD model, which has been created with CATIA V5, the used airfoil of the aircraft and the XFLR5 simulation files.

For a further understanding is the assignment attached as a pdf. Due to a page restriction in the main part, is the design report of the system attached as an appendix.
